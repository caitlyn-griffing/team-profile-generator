# Team Profile Generator

## Description

I have built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so I've also writen a unit test for every part of my code to ensure that it passes each test.
